# financial-signal-processing
Designing and implementing an equities trader using principles of signal processing and Python.
Final project for Olin College's Digital Signal Processing course [Spring 2015].

# Installation
The code here relies on the scipy/numpy stack as well as pandas. Those with the Anaconda distribution should only have to install the following--
- `pip install arrow`
- `pip install pyalgotrade`

One data gathering function requires the 'Requests' module. This is included in the Anaconda distribution.
Those not using Anaconda may run `sudo pip install requests` to install this.
